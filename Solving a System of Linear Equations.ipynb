(10 pts) Create a function GaussSeidel(A, b, err) which solves a system of linear equations $Ax = b$ by using Gauss-Seidel interation method. Set $x^{(0)} = \\vec{0}$. We stop the iteration when the estimation of the error $||x^{(k)} - x^{(k-1)}||_\\infty$ is less than err or $k = 1000$. (Here $x^{(k)}$ is the $k$-th output of the iteration)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"UoSWoAL4UCC9","outputId":"5c887d2a-e39b-4168-a89d-ca142edff472"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["gauss-seidel method\n","rotation:  0   x:  [ 0.5         2.83333333 -1.08333333]      xprev:  [0 0 0] \n","\n","Error:  2.833333333333333\n","rotation:  1   x:  [ 1.91666667  2.94444444 -1.02777778]      xprev:  [ 0.5         2.83333333 -1.08333333] \n","\n","Error:  1.4166666666666665\n","rotation:  2   x:  [ 1.97222222  2.98148148 -1.00925926]      xprev:  [ 1.91666667  2.94444444 -1.02777778] \n","\n","Error:  0.05555555555555558\n","rotation:  3   x:  [ 1.99074074  2.99382716 -1.00308642]      xprev:  [ 1.97222222  2.98148148 -1.00925926] \n","\n","Error:  0.01851851851851838\n","rotation:  4   x:  [ 1.99691358  2.99794239 -1.00102881]      xprev:  [ 1.99074074  2.99382716 -1.00308642] \n","\n","Error:  0.006172839506172867\n","rotation:  5   x:  [ 1.99897119  2.99931413 -1.00034294]      xprev:  [ 1.99691358  2.99794239 -1.00102881] \n","\n","Error:  0.002057613168724215\n","rotation:  6   x:  [ 1.99965706  2.99977138 -1.00011431]      xprev:  [ 1.99897119  2.99931413 -1.00034294] \n","\n","Error:  0.000685871056241405\n","[ 1.99965706  2.99977138 -1.00011431]\n"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","def printmatrix(M):\n","    for i in range (0,len(M)):\n","        for j in range(0, len(M)):\n","            print(M[i][j], \" \", end = \"\")\n","        print(\"\")\n","\n","        \n","def MultiplyMatrix(A,B):\n","    if (len(A[0])==len(B)):\n","        product = np.zeros((len(A),len(B[0])))\n","        for i in range(0, len(A)):\n","            for j in range(0, len(B[0])):\n","                for k in range(0, len(B)):\n","                    product[i][j] = product[i][j]+A[i][k]*B[k][j]\n","    return product\n","\n","def MultiplyMatrixVector(A,b):\n","    if (len(A[0])==len(b)):\n","        product = np.zeros((len(A)))\n","        for i in range(0, len(A)):\n","            for j in range(0, len(b)):\n","                product[i]= product[i]+A[i][j]*b[j]\n","    return product\n","\n","\n","def AugmentMatrixInverse(A):\n","    augmatrix = np.zeros((len(A),2*len(A)))\n","    for i in range(0, len(A)):\n","        for j in range(0, 2*len(A)):\n","            if j < len(A) and i < len(A):\n","                augmatrix[i][j] = A[i][j]\n","    for i in range(0, len(A)):\n","        for j in range(len(A), 2*len(A)):\n","            if(j-len(A)==i):\n","                augmatrix[i][j] = 1\n","            else:\n","                augmatrix[i][j] = 0\n","    return augmatrix\n","\n","def Inverse(A):\n","    newA = AugmentMatrixInverse(A)\n","    n = len(newA)\n","    NROW = np.zeros(n)\n","    pfound = False\n","    for i in range(0,n):\n","        NROW[i] = i\n","    for i in range(0, n-1):\n","        p = i\n","        maxim = 0\n","        for j in range(i, n):\n","            if(pfound == False):\n","                if(np.absolute(newA[int(NROW[j])][i])>maxim):\n","                    maxim = np.absolute(newA[int(NROW[j])][i])\n","                if(np.absolute(newA[int(NROW[p])][i])==maxim):\n","                    p = j\n","                    pfound = True\n","        if(newA[int(NROW[p])][i]==0):\n","            print('matrix is singular')\n","        \n","        if(NROW[i] != NROW[p]):\n","            temp = NROW[i]\n","            NROW[i] = NROW[p]\n","            NROW[p] = temp\n","        m = np.zeros((n,n+1))\n","        for j in range(i+1, n):\n","            m[int(NROW[j])][i]=newA[int(NROW[j])][i]/newA[int(NROW[i])][i]\n","            newA[int(NROW[j])]=newA[int(NROW[j])]- (m[int(NROW[j])][i]*newA[int(NROW[i])])\n","                     \n","    if(newA[int(NROW[n-1])][n-1]==0):\n","        print('matrix is singular')\n","        \n","    for i in reversed(range(0,n)):\n","        for j in reversed(range(0,i+1)):\n","            #print(i, ' ', j)\n","            if j == i:\n","                newA[int(NROW[i])] = newA[int(NROW[i])]/newA[int(NROW[i])][j]\n","                largesti = int(NROW[i])\n","                for k in reversed(range(0,i)):\n","                    newA[int(NROW[k])] = newA[int(NROW[k])] -
